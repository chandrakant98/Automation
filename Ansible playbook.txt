Ansible
Ansible is an open-source Python tool used to automate a variety of critical IT tasks, including application deployment, configuration management, server provisioning, and more.

At a very high-level, Ansible works by promoting the development of playbooks (written in YAML), while IT administrators write “plays” that are defined by tasks. These tasks dictate the instructions to be executed on the remote hosts.

For example, the following is an Ansible playbook designed to streamline the process for setting up an Apache web server on one or more remote hosts:

---
- hosts: all
  become: true
  vars:
    vars/variables.yml
  tasks:
    - name: Update apt-cache
      apt: update_cache=yes

    - name: Install apache web server
      apt: name=apache2 state=latest

    - name: Create document root
      file: path={{ document_root_path }} state=directory owner=www-data group=www-data

    - name: Copy index.html
      copy: src=index.html dest={{ document_root_path }}/index.html owner=”{{ owner }}” mode=0644

    - name: Set up virtual hosts file
      template: src=virtualhosts.conf dest=/etc/apache2/sites-available/000-default.conf
      notify: Restart Apache
  
  handlers:
    - name: Restart Apache
      service: name=apache2 state=restarted
